# Voxel-Game-Engine | _C++, OpenGL, Perlin Noise, Visual Studio_

&emsp; This is a voxel game engine inspired by Minecraft, featuring an infinite and interactive world. <br/>
&emsp; The terrain and vegetation are generated using Perlin Noise, and they are divided into chunks. <br/>
&emsp; All textures for the blocks are made from scratch. <br/>
&emsp; I do not own the Perlin Noise library which was used in the program. <br/>
